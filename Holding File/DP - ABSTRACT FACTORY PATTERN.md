# ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN

## OVERVIEW

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Abstract Factory Pattern is used by software developers and architects who want to create a flexible and extensible system with interchangeable object families. The Abstract Factory Pattern can be applied in scenarios where a system needs to support multiple families of related objects and the specific implementations of those objects need to be determined dynamically.

- A system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with multiple families of objects and clients should be able to create objects from one of these families at runtime.
- A system needs to enforce a constraint on the classes of objects that can be created together.

## PROS OF USING ABSTRACT PATTERN

- Encapsulation: The Abstract Factory Pattern encapsulates the creation and composition logic of objects, providing a central place to create object families. This helps in keeping the code modular and maintainable.
- Flexibility: By using the Abstract Factory Pattern, the client code becomes independent of the concrete classes of objects, making it easier to switch between different families of objects or add new families without modifying existing client code.
- Dependency Injection: The Abstract Factory Pattern promotes dependency injection, allowing objects to be created and injected via interfaces. This facilitates loose coupling and improves testability.

## CONS OF USING ABSTRACT PATTERN

- Complexity: Implementing the Abstract Factory Pattern can introduce additional complexity to the codebase, as it requires defining multiple interfaces, concrete factories, and related objects.
- Extensibility Challenges: Adding new types of objects or extending existing families of objects may require modifications to the abstract factory interface and all concrete factory implementations.
- Runtime Overhead: The use of the Abstract Factory Pattern can introduce some runtime overhead due to the indirection involved in creating objects through the abstract factory interface.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT ABSTRACT PATTERN

1. Define Abstract Factory Interface:
   - Create an abstract factory interface that declares methods for creating each type of object in a family.
   - The interface should be responsible for defining the contract for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. Implement Concrete Factories:
   - Create concrete factory classes that implement the abstract factory interface.
   - Each concrete factory is responsible for instantiating and returning specific objects from a family.

3. Define Abstract Product Interfaces:
   - Create abstract product interfaces that define the common methods for objects in each family.
   - Each interface represents a product that can be created by the abstract factory.

4. Implement Concrete Products:
   - Create concrete product classes that implement the abstract product interfaces.
   - Each concrete product represents a specific implementation of an object in a family.

5. Create Client Code:
   - The client code should depend on the abstract factory interface rather than the concrete factories or products.
   - Use the abstract factory to create objects, and work with the abstract product interfaces in the client code.
