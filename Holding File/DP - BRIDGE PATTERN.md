# BRIDGE PATTERN

## OVERVIEW

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. The Bridge Pattern is used by software developers and architects who want to separate the abstraction and implementation of a system, allowing them to change and evolve independently. The Bridge Pattern is applicable when there is a need to separate an abstraction and its implementation into different hierarchies. It is often used when the system needs to support multiple platforms, database types, or other variations.

The Bridge Pattern is suitable when:

- There is a need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
- Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should not affect clients that rely on the abstraction.
- There is a need to extend the system with new abstractions and implementations independently.

## PROS TO USING BRIDGE PATTERN

- Decoupling: The Bridge Pattern promotes loose coupling between the abstraction and implementation, enabling them to evolve independently. Changes in one part of the system do not affect the other, allowing for easier maintenance and extensibility.
- Flexibility: By separating the abstraction and implementation, the Bridge Pattern allows for variations and customization. It enables the system to support multiple implementations and easily switch between them at runtime.
- Reusability: The Bridge Pattern allows the reuse of both abstractions and implementations. Abstractions can be reused with different implementations, and implementations can be reused with different abstractions.

## CONS TO USING BRIDGE PATTERN

- Increased Complexity: Implementing the Bridge Pattern can introduce additional complexity, as it requires defining multiple hierarchies and interfaces for both the abstraction and implementation.
- Overhead: The Bridge Pattern introduces an extra layer of indirection, which can result in a slight runtime overhead compared to direct implementation access.
- Design Overkill: The Bridge Pattern may be overkill for simpler scenarios where there is only one abstraction and one implementation.

## HOW TO USE BRIDGE PATTERN

1. Define Abstraction:
   - Create an abstraction class or interface that defines the high-level functionality and declares a reference to the implementation.
   - The abstraction should provide methods that encapsulate the behavior and delegate the implementation details to the implementation object.

2. Implement Abstraction:
   - Create concrete subclasses or implementations of the abstraction.
   - Each subclass should inherit from the abstraction class and implement its specific behavior by using the methods provided by the abstraction.

3. Define Implementation:
   - Create an implementation class or interface that defines the low-level functionality.
   - The implementation should provide methods that correspond to the operations defined in the abstraction.

4. Implement Concrete Implementations:
   - Create concrete classes that implement the implementation interface or extend the implementation class.
   - Each concrete implementation should provide the specific functionality required by the abstraction.

5. Connect Abstraction and Implementation:
   - Modify the abstraction class to have a reference to the implementation interface or class.
   - Implement the methods of the abstraction by delegating the implementation details to the implementation object.

6. Client Usage:
   - Clients should interact with the abstraction through its methods without being aware of the specific implementation.
   - The client code can choose the desired implementation at runtime and work with it seamlessly through the abstraction's interface.
