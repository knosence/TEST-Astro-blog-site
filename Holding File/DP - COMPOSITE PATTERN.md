# COMPOSITE PATTERN

## OVERVIEW

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The Composite Pattern is used by software developers and designers who need to represent hierarchical structures of objects and want to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly. The Composite Pattern can be applied in scenarios where a system needs to represent part-whole hierarchies, and clients need to interact with objects uniformly regardless of whether they are individual objects or groups of objects.

The Composite Pattern is suitable when:

- A system needs to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- Clients need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Operations need to be applied recursively over the objects in the hierarchy.

## PROS TO USING COMPOSITE PATTERN

- Flexibility: The Composite Pattern allows you to create complex object hierarchies and treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. This provides flexibility in manipulating and working with the objects.
- Simplified Client Code: Clients can work with objects using a single interface, regardless of whether they are individual objects or groups of objects. This simplifies client code and reduces the need for conditional logic.
- Scalability: The Composite Pattern allows for the easy addition of new objects and compositions to the hierarchy. This makes the system more scalable and adaptable to changes.

## CONS TO USING COMPOSITE PATTERN

- Complexity: Implementing the Composite Pattern can introduce additional complexity to the codebase, as it requires defining a common interface for both individual objects and compositions, and handling recursive operations on the hierarchy.
- Performance Overhead: The use of the Composite Pattern can introduce some performance overhead, especially when performing operations recursively on large hierarchies.
- Limited Type Checking: The common interface used by the Composite Pattern may limit type checking and prevent the compiler from catching certain errors at compile-time.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT COMPOSITE PATTERN

1. Define Component Interface:
   - Create an interface that declares the common methods for both individual objects and compositions.
   - This interface should provide operations that can be performed on objects in the hierarchy.

2. Implement Leaf Objects:
   - Create classes that implement the Component interface for individual objects in the hierarchy.
   - These classes represent the leaf objects that do not have any child objects.

3. Implement Composite Objects:
   - Create classes that implement the Component interface for compositions of objects.
   - These classes represent the composite objects that can contain both leaf objects and other composite objects.

4. Manage Child Objects:
   - In the composite classes, implement methods to add, remove, and access child objects.
   - These methods should handle the management of child objects in the hierarchy.

5. Implement Operations:
   - Implement the operations defined in the Component interface in both leaf and composite classes.
   - The leaf classes will implement the operations directly, while the composite classes will delegate the operations to their child objects recursively.

6. Use the Composite Structure:
   - Create a client code that interacts with the objects in the hierarchy using the Component interface.
   - The client code can work with both individual objects and compositions uniformly, without knowing the specific classes.
