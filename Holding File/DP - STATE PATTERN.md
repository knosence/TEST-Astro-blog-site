# STATE PATTERN

## OVERVIEW

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes and delegates the execution to the appropriate class based on the current state.

The State Pattern is used by software developers and architects who want to implement a system where an object's behavior changes dynamically based on its internal state.

The State Pattern can be applied in situations where an object's behavior needs to change dynamically based on its internal state, and the object's class should not have multiple conditional statements that determine its behavior.

The State Pattern is suitable when:

- An object's behavior changes depending on its internal state, and the number of states is large or subject to change.
- There are multiple operations that need to be executed based on the object's state.
- There is a need to avoid using conditional statements to determine the behavior of an object based on its state.

## PROS OF USING STATE PATTERN

- Encapsulation: The State Pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, improving code modularity and maintainability.
- Extensibility: Adding new states or modifying existing states becomes easier as each state is encapsulated in its own class.
- Flexibility: The State Pattern allows objects to change their behavior dynamically at runtime, promoting a more flexible and adaptable design.

## CONS OF USING STATE PATTERN

- Increased Number of Classes: Implementing the State Pattern can lead to an increased number of classes, especially if there are numerous states and operations associated with the object.
- Increased Complexity: The State Pattern introduces additional complexity to the codebase, as it requires defining state classes and managing state transitions.
- Potential Performance Overhead: Depending on the implementation, the State Pattern can introduce a slight performance overhead due to the indirection involved in delegating behavior to different state classes.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT STATE PATTERN

1. Define State Interface:
   - Create an interface that defines the common methods for all state classes.
   - This interface represents the contract for the behavior associated with each state.

2. Implement Concrete State Classes:
   - Create concrete state classes that implement the state interface.
   - Each concrete state class encapsulates the behavior specific to a particular state.

3. Integrate State into Context:
   - Modify the context class to maintain a reference to the current state object.
   - Provide methods in the context class to allow the client code to change the state or perform operations based on the current state.

4. Handle State Transitions:
   - Define methods in the state interface and concrete state classes to handle state transitions.
   - The context class should delegate state transition requests to the current state object.

5. Client Code Interaction:
   - The client code should interact with the context class and invoke methods to perform operations on the object.
   - The context class internally delegates the execution of the operation to the current state object.
