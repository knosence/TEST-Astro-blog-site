# QUICK SORT
## OVERVIEW

Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays. Quick Sort is used by programmers and developers who need to sort arrays or lists of elements in various applications and programming languages. Quick Sort can be applied to any scenario where sorting is required, such as sorting arrays, lists, or other data structures. Quick Sort is suitable for sorting large arrays or lists where efficiency is crucial. It performs well on average, but its worst-case time complexity can be a concern in some cases.

## PROS OF USING QUICK SORT
- Efficient: Quick Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it one of the fastest sorting algorithms.
- In-place Sorting: Quick Sort can be implemented in a way that requires only a constant amount of additional memory.
- Versatile: Quick Sort can be easily implemented recursively or iteratively, and it can handle various data types and input sizes.

## CONS OF USING QUICK SORT
- Worst-case Time Complexity: In the worst-case scenario, Quick Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can happen if the pivot selection is unbalanced. However, this can be mitigated by using randomized or median-of-three pivot selection.
- Unstable Sort: By default, Quick Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.
- Recursive Overhead: Quick Sort relies on recursive calls, which can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too large.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT QUICK SORT

1. **Partitioning:**
   - Select a pivot element from the array. This can be the first, last, or a randomly chosen element.
   - Reorder the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.
   - The pivot should now be in its final sorted position in the array.

2. **Recursion:**
   - Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarray on the left of the pivot (elements smaller than the pivot).
   - Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarray on the right of the pivot (elements greater than the pivot).

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the subarray has fewer than two elements, it is already considered sorted, and no further action is needed.

4. **Combine:**
   - As Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, no explicit combining step is required.

The implementation of Quick Sort involves the partitioning of the array and recursively sorting the subarrays. The choice of the pivot element and the partitioning technique can vary, and different strategies can be used to optimize the algorithm's performance.

It's important to handle the base case properly to avoid infinite recursion, and care should be taken to select a balanced pivot to prevent worst-case time complexity.
