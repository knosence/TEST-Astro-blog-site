# DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
## OVERVIEW

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores a graph or tree structure by visiting vertices as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS can be implemented by programmers or software developers to traverse and analyze graph or tree structures. DFS can be applied to any graph or tree data structure where the relationships between nodes are represented by edges or links. DFS is commonly used when there is a need to explore all the vertices or nodes in a graph or tree structure. It is useful for tasks such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, and searching for paths or routes.

## PROS OF USING DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
- Connectivity: DFS explores all reachable vertices from a given source vertex, making it useful for determining the connectivity of a graph or finding connected components.
- Memory Efficiency: DFS uses a stack or recursion for tracking and visiting nodes, which requires less memory compared to other traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) that use a queue.
- Topological Ordering: DFS can be used to generate a topological ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is useful for tasks such as scheduling or dependency resolution.

## CONS OF USING DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
- Completeness: DFS does not guarantee that all vertices will be visited in disconnected graphs. It only visits vertices that are reachable from the starting vertex.
- Performance in Dense Graphs: In dense graphs with many edges, DFS may take longer to complete due to the potential for extensive backtracking.
- Lack of Optimal Solution: DFS does not necessarily find the shortest path between two vertices. For finding the shortest path, other algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search are more suitable.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH (DFS)

To implement Depth-First Search:

1. Create a data structure to track visited nodes:
   - Initialize a boolean array or set to keep track of visited nodes.

2. Start at a specific source vertex:
   - Mark the source vertex as visited.
   - Process or perform any necessary operations on the visited vertex.

3. Traverse adjacent unvisited vertices:
   - For each adjacent vertex of the current vertex:
     - If the adjacent vertex has not been visited:
       - Mark the adjacent vertex as visited.
       - Recursively call the DFS function on the adjacent vertex.

4. Repeat step 3 until all reachable vertices are visited.
5. Handle disconnected graphs (optional):
   - If there are unvisited vertices remaining, repeat steps 2-4 for each unvisited vertex until all vertices are visited.

By following these steps, DFS explores a graph or tree by recursively visiting adjacent vertices and backtracking only when all reachable vertices from a specific node have been visited. The algorithm continues until all vertices have been visited or until the desired condition or goal is met. The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
