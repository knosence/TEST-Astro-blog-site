# ARRAYS

## OVERVIEW

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. They provide random access to elements using their indices. Arrays are used in various programming contexts, including algorithms, data processing, simulations, and applications where a collection of elements needs to be stored and accessed efficiently. Arrays are used when you have a known number of elements of the same type that need to be stored and accessed using indices. They are commonly used in scenarios where direct and efficient access to elements is required.

## PROS OF USING AN ARRAY

- Random Access: Elements in an array can be accessed directly using their index, allowing for constant-time access. This makes it efficient to retrieve elements by their position.
- Efficiency: Arrays have a fixed size and memory allocation, resulting in efficient memory usage and fast access to elements.
- Simple Data Structure: Arrays are a fundamental and straightforward data structure, supported by most programming languages and easily understood by developers.
- Cache-Friendly: Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, which enhances cache performance and improves access speed.
## CONS OF USING AN ARRAY

- Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size determined during initialization, and it cannot be changed dynamically. This can be limiting if the number of elements needs to grow or shrink frequently.
- Insertion and Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array requires shifting elements, resulting in a time-consuming operation, especially for large arrays.
- Memory Wastage: If an array is initialized with a larger size than required, it may lead to memory wastage if the array is not fully utilized.
- Lack of Flexibility: Arrays are inflexible in terms of modifying their size or accommodating different data types. They require explicit resizing and can only store elements of the same data type.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT AN ARRAY

1. Define the Array Blueprint:
	- Create a new Blueprint called "Array" to represent the Array data structure.
	- Declare private variables to store the elements of the array.
	- Implement the constructor to initialize the elements of the array.
2. Initialize the Array:
	- Allocate memory for the array based on the specified size or capacity.
	- Assign the elements to the corresponding positions in the array.
	- Ensure that the array cannot be modified once initialized.
3. Access Element at Index:
	- Implement a method to access an element at a given index in the array.
	- Validate the index to ensure it is within the valid range of indices (from 0 to array length - 1).
	- Return the element at the specified index.
4. Search for an Element:
	- Implement a method to search for a specific element in the array.
	- Iterate through the elements in the array and compare each element with the target value.
	- Return the index of the first occurrence of the target element or a specified value to indicate its absence.
5. Size of the Array:
	- Implement a method to return the length of the array.
	- This can be simply the value of the private variable that represents the length.
6. Additional Operations:
	- Implement any additional methods specific to your use case, such as mapping, filtering, or reducing the elements in the array.
	- Ensure that these methods return a new Array instance instead of modifying the original array.
