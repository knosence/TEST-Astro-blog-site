# Dynamic Arrays

## OVERVIEW

An Dynamic Arrays  is a array-like data structure that allows flexible resizing and efficient random access. It stores elements sequentially and provides dynamic resizing as elements are added or removed. Dynamic Arrays s are used in various programming contexts where you need a dynamically re-sizable array with efficient random access to elements. They are commonly used for storing and manipulating collections of objects. Dynamic Arrays s are used when you need a data structure that offers the benefits of an array (random access) but with the ability to resize dynamically as elements are added or removed.

## PROS OF AN Dynamic Arrays 

- Random Access: Dynamic Arrays s provide efficient random access to elements based on their index. This allows for quick retrieval and modification of elements, especially when you know their position.
- Dynamic Resizing: Dynamic Arrays s automatically resize themselves as elements are added or removed. This dynamic resizing capability eliminates the need for manual memory management and provides flexibility in handling collections of varying sizes.
- Familiar Interface: Dynamic Arrays s typically provide a straightforward interface that is easy to understand and use. They often offer methods for adding, removing, updating, and retrieving elements, making them convenient for managing collections of objects.
- Performance Trade-off: Dynamic Arrays s offer a balance between efficient random access and reasonable performance for sequential access. They are a suitable choice when you need both random and sequential access to elements.
- Compatible with Collection APIs: Dynamic Arrays s typically implement common collection interfaces, making them compatible with a wide range of APIs and libraries. This allows for seamless integration with other parts of your codebase.
- Interoperability: Dynamic Arrays s are often supported in various programming languages, frameworks, and platforms. This interoperability allows for easier collaboration, code sharing, and integration in multi-language or multi-platform projects.
- Memory Efficiency: In some cases, Dynamic Arrays s can be more memory-efficient compared to linked data structures. They store elements contiguously in memory, which reduces overhead and improves cache locality.
- Familiarity and Community Support: Dynamic Arrays s are a widely used data structure with extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support. This availability of resources can make it easier to learn, troubleshoot, and maintain code that uses Dynamic Arrays s.  

## CONS OF AN Dynamic Arrays 

- Dynamic Resizing Overhead: As elements are added or removed from an Dynamic Arrays , it may need to dynamically resize, which can incur overhead in terms of memory reallocation and copying elements to the new array.
- Insertion and Removal in the Middle: Insertion or removal of elements in the middle of an Dynamic Arrays  requires shifting all subsequent elements, which can be time-consuming for large lists.
- Memory Usage: Dynamic Arrays s may occupy more memory than their current size due to internal capacity management. This can be a concern when memory usage is a critical factor.
- Sequential Access Performance: While Dynamic Arrays s provide efficient random access, sequential access or iteration over all elements can be slower compared to linked data structures.
- Not Suitable for Primitive Types: In some programming languages, Dynamic Arrays s may not directly support primitive types (e.g., int, boolean) and require boxing and unboxing operations.
- Lack of Structural Modifications: When multiple threads concurrently modify an Dynamic Arrays  without proper synchronization, it can lead to data inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
- Lack of Specialized Operations: Dynamic Arrays s do not provide specialized operations like stack or queue operations, which may require additional data structures or custom implementations.
- Poor Performance for Large Data Sets: If the Dynamic Arrays  exceeds its internal capacity, resizing operations can become costly and impact performance, especially for large data sets.
- Not Sorted by Default: Dynamic Arrays s do not provide inherent sorting capabilities. If you require sorted data, you need to manually sort the elements or consider using other data structures.

## HOW TO IMPLEMENT AN Dynamic Arrays  h-10000

1. Define the Dynamic Arrays  Blueprint: 
	- Declare a private array to store the elements. The array will have a generic type to allow for storing elements of any type.
	- Declare a private variable to track the current number of elements in the array. 
	- Implement the constructor to initialize the initial capacity and any other necessary variables.
2. Define Internal Array: 
	- Declare a private array of a generic type to store the elements of the Dynamic Arrays .
3. Initialize Array: 
	- Allocate an initial capacity for the internal array. This capacity can be passed as a parameter to the constructor or set to a default value. 
	- Initialize the current number of elements to zero.
4. Add an Element: 
	- Check if the current number of elements is equal to the array capacity. If it is, call the "Resize Array" procedure to increase the capacity of the internal array. 
	- Add the new element to the end of the array, using the current number of elements as the index. 
	- Increment the current number of elements.
5. Get an Element: 
	- Validate the index to ensure it is within the valid range of indices (from 0 to current number of elements - 1). 
	- Return the element at the specified index from the internal array.
6. Remove an element: 
	- Validate the index to ensure it is within the valid range of indices (from 0 to current number of elements - 1). 
	- Retrieve the element at the specified index from the internal array. 
	- Shift the remaining elements in the array to fill the gap left by the removed element. This can be done by starting from the index of the removed element and moving all subsequent elements one position to the left. 
	- Decrement the current number of elements.
7. Get the Size of the Dynamic Arrays : 
	- Return the current number of elements stored in the Dynamic Arrays . This can be simply the value of the private variable that tracks the number of elements.
8. Resizing the Dynamic Arrays : 
	- Create a new array with a larger size, such as double the current capacity or a specific growth factor. 
	- Copy the existing elements from the old array to the new array. This involves iterating over the elements in the old array and assigning them to the corresponding positions in the new array. 
	- Update the reference to the internal array with the new array, so that the Dynamic Arrays  now points to the resized array. 
	- Update the capacity of the Dynamic Arrays  to reflect the new size.
9. Validate Index:
	- Check if the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the current number of elements. If it is, throw an exception or handle the invalid index according to the desired error handling mechanism.
10. Additional Operations: 
	- Implement other operations as needed, such as: 
		- checking if the Dynamic Arrays  is empty by comparing the current number of elements to zero, clearing all elements by setting the current number of elements to zero, 
		- searching for a specific element by iterating over the elements and comparing them to the target value.
