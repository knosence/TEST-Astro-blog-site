## EXPRESSION

### ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR

JS: The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

## DECLARATION

JS: A declaration is a statement that declares a variable by describing its type.

## TYPES (Type Systems)
TS: Refers to  TypeScript's understanding of how your code is meant to function: mainly what data types should be stored under your variables. 

### TYPE INFERENCE
TS: TypeScript expects the data type of the variable to match the type of  the value initially assigned to it at its declaration - this is known as type inference.
