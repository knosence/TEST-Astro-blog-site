# Trading Plan

### BOS :

- Break of Structure : signals continuation
- Body (not the wick) must clear the HL or LH to be considered a BOS,
- Bullish BOS : L,H,HL,\*_HH_,HL,\*_HH_
- Bearish BOS : H,L,LH,\*_LL_,LH,\*_LL_

### Pullbacks :

- 3 bullish or bearish candles, who's bodies close below the previous candle (including the wick), in the opposite direction of price.
- Candles do not need to be consecutive (meaning: if two Bullish candle is preceded by a micro pullback (still within the swing) and price reverses and a new bullish candle close below the other two.)
- Bullish Pullbacks : L,H,\*_HL_,HH,\*_HL_,HH
- Bearish Pullbacks : H,L,\*_LH_,LL,\*_LH_,LL

### Swings :

- Swings are the Lowest or highest points in the macro (not the micro) structure of price in the market.
- External Swings points are where reversals happen.
- There must be a pullback to be considered a swing point. Otherwise it is not considered a swing point and is a continuation of the current leg.
- Bullish Swing High: L,\*_H_,\*_HL_,\*_HH_,\*_HL_,\*_HH_
- Bearish Swing Low: H,\*_L_,\*_LH_,\*_LL_,\*_LH_,\*_LL_

### ChoCH :

- Change of Character : signals reversal
- Body (not the wick) must clear HH or LL to be considered a CHoCH
- Bullish to Bearish CHoCH : L,H,HL,HH,\*_LL_,LH,LL
- Bearish to Bullish CHoCH : H,L,LH,LL,\*_HH_,HL,HH

### Liquidity :

- Is what is used to give price it's steam to move bullish or bearish
- Areas where there is accumulation or distribution (Chop or range)
- Or price did not break and close (BAC) but has wicked past HH to take the orders placed on or above the last HH.
- or equal lows or highs. 
- or trend lines (three or more touches)

### Fractals :

- Micro swing structures that has internal ChoCH and BOS.
- Micro must align with Macro.

### Imbalance :
- When the (first) candle and the (third) candle after the (second) impulse candle doesn't meet causing an gap (imbalance) in the price that needs to be filled. 
- it is either an area of demand (if price goes down) or an area of supply (if price goes up)
- Imbalances occurs when an access of orders come into the market at that specific time.
	- big money has placed a large amount of orders, leaving a footprint.
- Imbalance setups can be :
	- bearish bearish bearish 
	- bearish bullish bearish
	- bearish bullish bullish. 
	- or
	- bullish bullish bullish
	- bullish bearish bullish
	- bullish bearish bearish

### Orderblocks :

#### Demand :

- Makes price go up because price is at a premium and everyone wants to buy.
- For example: Auctions where there is one item and a lot of bids putting in the highest they will pay for that item.
    - 1 Apple to 100 people
    - more buy orders the sell orders
    - Bullish

##### Demand Zones :

- The final Buy order (candle) that pushes price in ops that left imbalance
- A bearish candle followed by a impulse bullish candle.
- The demand zone acts as a catalyst for price to have a bearish pullback and bullish continuation.

#### Supply :

- Makes price go done because price got too expensive
- For example: Air is so inexpensive that no one (in their right mind) will pay for something that is way too abundant.
    - 100 Apples to 1 person
    - more sell orders then buy orders
    - Bearish

##### Supply Zone

- The final sell order (candle) that pushes price in ops that left imbalance
- A bullish candle followed by a impulsive bearish candle.
- The supply zone acts as a catalyst for price to have a bullish pullback and a bearish continuation.

### Entry :

- *HTF* (Set up should be at a LL or a HH)
	- Directional bias = bearish (LL) or bullish (HH)
	- after break of structure w/ imbalance -> mark s/d zone
	- switch to LTF
	- *LTF* (Pullback into a CHoCH: finding imbalance)
		- wait for price to pullback into HTF S/D zone
		- wait for a LTF CHoCH
		- identify imbalance that should indicate that the previous candle is a S/D zone.
		- set alert for price to enter zone
		- once price enter zone: Set Entry (1 to 5 risk reward)
			- *Set Entry* at the start of s/d zone area
			- *Stop lose* at top of S/D zone
			- *Take profit / exit* targeting the HTF swing low

Step 1 - Directional Bias
Step 2 - Supply and Demand (orderblock)
Step 3 - Liquidity As Cause
Step 4 - Multi Time Frame Fractals
Step 5 - Putting it together with entries
